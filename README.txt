Weapon Selection Menu Mod for GZDoom

Usage:

1. Assign controls in Options -> Customize controls -> "Weapon Menu Keys".

2. Open Weapons Menu by pressing assigned Smart Selection Keys or Open/Close Menu key.

3. Cycle through the Weapons Menu with Smart Selection Keys or Next/Previous weapon keys.

4. Smart Selection Keys cycle through all the weapons in one slot.

5. If Menu is closed, Next/Previous weapon keys act as standard Next/Previous weapon Keys.

6. Close Weapons Menu, and highlighted weapon is selected.

7. Weapons Menu does not affect gameplay. When it is opened, you can run, shoot, do whatever you want to do. New weapon will be selected only when Menu is closed.

Features:
- provides ability to fast weapon selection even without using number row keys.
- with menu, you see what you are about to select. No more blind weapon choices!
- last used weapon quick access (by assigned key).
- configurable colors and position.
- will work with any HUD.

Weapon sets are detected by player class. So support for other weapon sets can
be easily added by modifying weapon-menu.acs:
  1. Increment SETS_NUMBER constant,
  2. Then add new player class to "playerClassNames" array,
  3. Then add number of weapons in this weapon set to "weaponCounts" array,
  4. Then add weapon slot list to "slots" array,
  5. Then add list of weapon classes to "names" array,
  6. Then add list of printable weapon names to "printableNames" array.
  7. Compile ACS.
